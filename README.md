# About the Ukebox
the Ukebox is an autonomous self playing ukelele meant to be a sort of jukebox for the IGEN clubroom on the UBC Campus. We intend to create the ukebox using servo motors to pluck the strings, a 3x3 grid of linear actuator to hold down the frets, and code to put the two parts in sync. There are two subteams working on the Ukebox. The "Box" Team, in charge of all the code and electrical work, and the "Uke" team, in charge of all the 3d modeling and design. 

# Box Team
The box team will be in charge of coding the servo motors, and the linear actuator grid, as well as interfacing between the two.
